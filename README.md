# Bond Elongation Index (BEI) 
Bond Elongation Index (BEI), a bond-length-based index, for characterizing polyhedral distortions of perovskite units with the specific purpose of quanterfying the anisotropic ferroelectric distortions using a Python script

# Structure files
Crystal_structure_KNO_with_Strain directory contains all POSCAR converged structure files used in "Enhanced polarization in epitaxially strained monoclinic potassium niobate for lead-free electromechanical applications" work
